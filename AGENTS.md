## What This Project Does

Scrapes and archives Indian District Court judgments from eCourts (services.ecourts.gov.in). Two scrapers exist: a **mobile API scraper** (recommended, no CAPTCHA) and a **web scraper** (requires CAPTCHA solving via ML models).

## Development Commands

```bash
# Mobile scraper — two-stage pipeline, run from repo root
cd mobile && uv sync

# Stage 1: Collect metadata (no PDF downloads)
uv run python scraper.py --state 29 --district 22 --start-year 2020 --end-year 2025

# Stage 2: Download PDFs from collected metadata
uv run python pdf_stage.py --state 29 --district 22 --start-year 2020 --end-year 2025

# Dry run (no S3 upload) — works for both stages
uv run python scraper.py --state 29 --district 22 --local-only
uv run python pdf_stage.py --state 29 --district 22 --local-only

# Re-run all searches ignoring checkpoints (catches new cases)
uv run python scraper.py --state 29 --district 22 --verify

# Web scraper — run from repo root
uv sync
uv run python web/download.py

# Lint
uv run ruff check .
```

There are no automated tests.

## Architecture

### Two Independent Scrapers

- **`mobile/`** — Uses the eCourts Android app API. All requests/responses are AES-CBC encrypted (`crypto.py`). The `api_client.py` handles encryption, auth (JWT), and all API calls. Two-stage pipeline:
  - **`scraper.py`** (Stage 1) — Iterates court hierarchy → searches cases by type/year → fetches case history → writes `metadata.tar`. No PDF downloads.
  - **`pdf_stage.py`** (Stage 2) — Reads `metadata.tar` from S3 → extracts `pdf_filename` from each case → downloads PDFs via `download_pdf_direct()` with a fresh JWT session → writes `data.tar`. Fully independent of Stage 1.
- **`web/`** — Uses the eCourts website. Requires CAPTCHA solving via ONNX/PyTorch models in `web/src/`. `download.py` is the entry point.

### Shared Components

- **`archive_manager.py`** (repo root) — Both scrapers use this for TAR archive creation, S3 uploads, and index tracking. Archives are partitioned at 1GB. Imported by mobile scraper via `sys.path` manipulation.
- **`gs.py`** (repo root) — PDF compression via Ghostscript. Used by web scraper and mobile pdf_stage.
- **`courts.csv`** — All 3,567 court complexes with state/district/complex codes.

### Reference Materials

- **`reference/traffic/`** — Captured HTTP traffic, Postman collection, and OpenAPI spec from reverse engineering the mobile API.

### Mobile API Encryption Flow

`crypto.py` has two hardcoded AES keys (from APK reverse engineering):
- `REQUEST_KEY` — encrypts client→server params
- `RESPONSE_KEY` — decrypts server→client responses

Request params format: `16 hex random_iv + 1 digit global_index + base64(ciphertext)`. PDF URL params use a different format: `32 hex IV + base64(ciphertext)`.

### S3 Data Layout

```
s3://bucket/data/tar/year=YYYY/state=XX/district=YY/complex=ZZ/data.tar
s3://bucket/metadata/tar/.../metadata.tar
s3://bucket/metadata/checkpoints/state=XX/district=YY/complex=ZZ/searches.json
s3://bucket/metadata/parquet/year=YYYY/state=XX/metadata.parquet
```

Index files (`*.index.json`) track which files are in each archive for resume capability.

### Search Checkpointing

Stage 1 writes a single `searches.json` per complex to avoid repeating ~1,200 search API calls on re-runs. Each entry is keyed by `"case_type_code/year/status"` with `{"found": N, "at": "ISO timestamp"}`. On re-run, completed searches are skipped (1 S3 GET to load, 1 PUT to flush). Use `--verify` to ignore checkpoints and re-run all searches (catches new cases filed since last run). Failed searches are never checkpointed — they always retry.

### Key State/District Codes

Telangana=29 (Mancherial=22, Rangareddy=6, Hyderabad=5). Full list in `courts.csv`.

## Important Conventions

- Python 3.13+ required. Uses `uv` for dependency management.
- Mobile scraper has its own `pyproject.toml` and venv; web scraper uses the root `pyproject.toml`.
- All timestamps use IST (UTC+5:30).
- SSL verification is disabled for eCourts API (`verify=False`).
- The mobile API has rate limiting — always include delays between requests (default 0.3s).
- Archives use uncompressed TAR format for speed.
- AWS profile: `dattam-od` (use `AWS_PROFILE=dattam-od` when running S3 operations).
